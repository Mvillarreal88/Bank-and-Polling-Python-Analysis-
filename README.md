# PyBank and PyPoll Analysis

In both the PyBank and PyPoll challenges we look to evaluate different records from the CSV file that we are pulling. We then look to extract necessary Data and present the results in a .txt file.

### For PyPoll we look to calculate the following

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period

* Calculate the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### For PyBank we look to calculate the following

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
